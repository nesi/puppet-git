# blank

This is a blank puppet module.

# Usage

Use this module to start a new blank puppet module with all the required components ready for submitting to Puppet Forge.

## Create a new blank module

1. Clone this repository:
    git clone -o puppet-blank -b master git://github.com/Aethylred/puppet-blank.git /path/to/new/repository

## Windows scripts

Provided are some Powershell scripts that can be used to manage the blank puppet module template.

## Enable execution of unsigned scripts

Powershell will not run unsigned scripts by default, this can be corrected by executing the following command in an Administrator Powershell. This is required before any of the other powershell scripts will run.

1. Click *Start* menu
2. Type "powershell" in the *Search programs and files* box, do not press enter.
3. When *Powershell* shows up in the search results, right click and select *Run as administrator*
4. Windows UAC may ask for permission to run as an administrator, click *Yes*
5. Run the following command in the administrator Powershell:
    set-executionpolicy remotesigned
6. Press *Enter* again to confirm the policy change

## Change author

1. Start Powershell in the blank module directory
2. Run the `setauthor.ps1` script:
    ./setauthor.ps1 newauthor
3. This creates a new `Modulefile` from `Modulefile.orig`, open it in an editor and check it's correct.
